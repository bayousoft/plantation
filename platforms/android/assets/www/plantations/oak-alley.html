It’s been called the most spectacular setting in the entire Mississippi River valley. A quarter-mile avenue of 300-year-old live oaks has made Oak Alley perhaps the most photographed plantation in the South. With its magnificently restored home, accommodations on the grounds, on-site period demonstrations and more, you’ll want to bring your camera and experience a by-gone era at Oak Alley, the grand dame of the Great River Road.
